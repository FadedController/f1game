# Welcome to this F1 inspired web mini-game

This project involves developing a web mini-game where you can answer questions about f1 tracks, drivers, teams and more!

## Project Arquitecture

This project uses React as the main technology for the logic and frontend. \
It also uses Google's firebase for signing in with Google and storing data \
For hosting I'm probably going to use firebase's built in service or netlify, but that will be clearer nearing production
